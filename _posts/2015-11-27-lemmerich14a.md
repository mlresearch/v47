title: A Critical View on Automatic Significance-Filtering in Pattern Mining
abstract: Statistically sound validation of results plays an important role in modern
  data mining. In this context, it has been advocated to disregard patterns that cannot
  be automatically confirmed as statistically valid by the available data. In this
  short position paper, we argue against a mandatory automatic significance filtering
  of results.

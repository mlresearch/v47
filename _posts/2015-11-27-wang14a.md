title: U-statistics on network-structured data with kernels of degree larger than
  one
abstract: Most analysis of U-statistics assumes that data points are independent or
  stationary. However, when we analyze network data, these two assumptions do not
  hold any more. We first define the problem of weighted U-statistics on networked
  data by extending previous work. We analyze their variance using Hoeffdingâ€™s decomposition
  and also give exponential concentration inequalities. Two efficiently solvable linear
  programs are proposed to find estimators with minimum worst-case variance or with
  tighter concentration inequalities.

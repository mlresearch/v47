title: Statistically significant subgraphs for genome-wide association study
abstract: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been widely used for understanding
  the associations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a disease. GWAS
  data are often combined with known biological networks, and they have been analyzed
  using graph-mining techniques toward a systems understanding of the biological changes
  caused by the SNPs. To determine which subgraphs are associated with the disease,
  a statistical test on each subgraph needs to be conducted. However, no statistically
  significant results were found because multiple testing correction causes an extremely
  small corrected significance level. We introduce a method called gLAMP to enumerate
  subgraphs having statistically significant associations with a diagnosis. gLAMP
  integrates the Limitless Arity Multiple-testing Procedure (LAMP) with a graph-mining
  algorithm called COmmon Itemset Network mining (COIN). LAMP gives us the smallest
  possible Bonferroni factor, and COIN provides us with efficient enumeration of testable
  subgraphs. Theoretical results of their combination show the potential to enumerate
  subgraphs statistically significantly associated with a disease.
